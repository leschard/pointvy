# Pointvy

## Why Pointvy

Trivy(server)less.

Pointvy is a simple web interface for manual run of the Trivy scanner. You define the image (optionnaly add some command options) and you get the result in a web page.
Pointvy is designed to run on a container serverless service like GCP's *Cloud Run* or Scaleway's *Serverless Containers*.

## Pointvy is not for you if
* You prefer to simply use Trivy in a console. -> [Trivy](https://aquasecurity.github.io/trivy/)
* You want to automate Trivy scans in a Kubernetes cluster. -> [Starboard](https://aquasecurity.github.io/starboard/).

## Deployment

# GCP CLoud Run

# Scaleway Serverless Containers
